# Step 1: Technology Stack Planning

## TASK
Create comprehensive technology stack documentation for a Taco Snake game. This is a PLANNING step only - you will document what technologies, architecture, and structure will be used for implementation in a future step.

## GAME SPECIFICATION
Read and understand the complete game requirements from the referenced `game_specification.md` file. Your technology stack must support ALL features, visual requirements, and technical requirements defined in that specification.

## INPUT FILES
- `game_specification.md` - Complete game requirements (features, visuals, technical specs)

## OUTPUT FILES
- `TECH_STACK.md` - Complete technology stack documentation including:
  - Chosen technologies and frameworks
  - Folder structure
  - Architecture patterns
  - File organization
  - Any libraries or dependencies

## CRITICAL - DO NOT
- ❌ DO NOT create any implementation files or code
- ❌ DO NOT create the actual folder structure
- ❌ DO NOT write code examples or snippets
- ❌ DO NOT create any files other than TECH_STACK.md
- ❌ DO NOT start implementing the game

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- ✅ TECH_STACK.md file created in the specified folder
- ✅ Document includes all required sections
- ✅ Clear definition of technologies to be used
- ✅ Architectural approach is well documented
- ✅ NO implementation files created
